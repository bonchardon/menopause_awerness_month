Key research quests and answers on them:

1) General discussion analysis
   - here we used lsa (Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)) algorithm (specify in more details why?), 
     since it is considered as one the best for conducting research topic identification (here: problem identification) 
     when it comes to natural language.
   - according to the results of the algorith applied, we can identify following key themes emerging from the conversation. 
     These are connected to health illness (?) of women (to be more specific menopause) and identifies possible need/urge/ 
      connection to seek assistance from a doctor and the overall need of common/comprehensive awareness with the problem. 
2) Treatment Options
    - here we are about to implement NER (named entity recognition) to withdraw one of the best possible treatment options. 
    - in this case we are about to use BioBert model, that was previously pretrained on medical texts/data, 
     thus it would be more efficient to get treatment options and identify which ones are the best (some percentage counter/metrics, etc.)
3) Healthcare Stakeholders 
4) Sentiment Analysis
